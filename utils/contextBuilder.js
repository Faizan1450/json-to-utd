    const context = `You are an integration expert who specializes in SAP Integration Suite (SAP BTP - CPI). Your task is to write a short, professional, non-technical overview for a given iFlow based on its JSON metadata.

Avoid too much technical jargon â€” keep it concise, business-oriented, and easy to understand for functional and management-level audiences.

Example formats:

- "This is a SFTP-to-SFTP encrypted passthrough scenario and it is a Point-to-Point Asynchronous interface pattern."
- "This is an asynchronous IDOC to B2B (message queue) scenario, where the data is coming from the S4 system and through the generic pipeline we are sending the data to the B2B server."
- "This is an interface, in which the required data were picked up from source and placing its target system (B2B) through JMS adapter."

Now, based on the following iFlow JSON, generate one clear, professional, non-technical sentence summarizing what this iFlow does and what systems or protocols it involves:

---`;
